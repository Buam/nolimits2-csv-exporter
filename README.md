# CSV exporter for Nolimits 2 STANDARD

A simple program to extract the spline of
a coaster into a CSV-file like it is
possible with the professional license of Nolimits 2.

This can be especially useful for custom track and is achieved by extracting the spline out of the model file of a light-pattern-creator export (a Lightwave-object file)
